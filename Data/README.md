## Data description

### Version 0.1
Filenames: *test_cleaned_v0.1.csv, train_cleaned_v0.1.csv*

- **Numerical features:** Columns added with imputation for missing by random numbers generated by normal distribution and random choice, respectively. Initial column for each numerical feature imputed by mean/median. No normalization of the data. New feature generated: operation_years.
- **Categorical features:** NaN values replaced by 'Missing', no reduction of feature dimension by grouping. Deletion of (seemingly) irrelevant features ('extraction_type_group','extraction_type_class','payment','quality_group','source_class','source_type','waterpoint_type_group','management_group','quantity_group','date_recorded','wpt_name','num_private','recorded_by')

### Version 0
Filenames: *test_cleaned.csv, train_cleaned.csv*

- **Numerical features:** Initial column for each numerical feature imputed by mean/median. No normalization of the data. New feature generated: operation_years.
- **Categorical features:** Reduction of feature dimension by grouping 'funder' (1050), 'installer' (765) and 'scheme_name' (296). Each expression of the feature with less appearances than specified in the brackets is replaced by 'Others'. Deletion of (seemingly) irrelevant features ('extraction_type_group','extraction_type_class','payment','quality_group','source_class','source_type','waterpoint_type_group','management_group','quantity_group','date_recorded','wpt_name','num_private','recorded_by')

Filenames: *test_cleaned_distr_imp.csv, train_cleaned_distr_imp.csv*

- **Numerical features:** Initial column for each numerical feature imputed by mean/median. No normalization of the data. New feature generated: operation_years. Columns added with imputation for missing by random numbers generated by normal distribution and random choice, respectively, for longitude and latitude only. 
- **Categorical features:** Reduction of feature dimension by grouping 'funder' (1050), 'installer' (765) and 'scheme_name' (296). Each expression of the feature with less appearances than specified in the brackets is replaced by 'Others'. Deletion of (seemingly) irrelevant features ('extraction_type_group','extraction_type_class','payment','quality_group','source_class','source_type','waterpoint_type_group','management_group','quantity_group','date_recorded','wpt_name','num_private','recorded_by')

### Initial preprocessing
Filename: *preprocessed_training_data.csv*

- **Numerical features:** Initial column for each numerical feature imputed by mean/median. Data normalized. New feature generated: operation_years.
